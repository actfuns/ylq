	- CHG: all high-level modules are now using same gdsl_map_func_t and 
	       gdsl_write_func_t, for mapping and writing data structures. 
	       These functions types have now an additional gdsl_location_t argument
	       that make this version not fully compatible with previous version.

  v1.3: 2004.04.10

               forms to improve speed.
	- CHG: canonical functions in permutation module are now in D. Knuth's
               canonical form.
	- CHG: a lot of protos and functions names has been modified in almost 
               all modules to improve acuracy and homogeneousness of symbol 
               names, so THIS VERSION IS *NOT* COMPATIBLE WHITH PREVIOUS ONE.
	- CHG: the heap module was removed and may be reintroduced in a future 
               version with a lot of functions. The sort function has been
