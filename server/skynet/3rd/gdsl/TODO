  This is a list of things left to do at this time (2006.06.21)
  (you can help if you want, see README file to see how contacting authors):

  *) Add gdsl_heap_remove method.

  *) Add a dichotomical search function for gdsl_list module.

  *) In all modules, replace recursvives functions by iteratives ones
     in case of HAVE_OPT_TIME is defined.

  *) Write the _gdsl_bintree_level_parse() function.

  *) Write the _gdsl_bstree_level_parse() function.

  *) Write a very complete english TeXinfo documentation including
     theoretical algorithmics and data structures aspects.
