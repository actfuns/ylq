  Introduction
  ============
   
  The Generic Data Structures Library (GDSL) is a collection of routines for
  generic data structures manipulation. It is a portable and re-entrant library 
  fully written from scratch in pure ANSI C. It is designed to offer for C 
  programmers common data structures with powerful algorithms, and hidden 
  implementation. Available structures are lists, queues, stacks, hash-tables, 
  binary trees, search binary trees, red-black trees, 2D arrays,
  permutations, heaps and interval heaps.
