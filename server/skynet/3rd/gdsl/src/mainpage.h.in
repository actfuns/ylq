 * @section about About
 *
 *  The Generic Data Structures Library (GDSL) is a collection of routines for
 *  generic data structures manipulation. It is a portable and re-entrant 
 *  library fully written from scratch in pure ANSI C. It is designed to offer
 *  for C programmers common data structures with powerful algorithms, and 
 *  hidden implementation. Available structures are lists, queues, stacks, hash
 *  tables, binary trees, binary search trees, red-black trees, 2D arrays,
 *  permutations, heaps and interval heaps.
